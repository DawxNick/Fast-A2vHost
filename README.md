# Fast-A2vHost
Quickly create Apache2 vHosts.

To use the script, run the following commands.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DawxNick/Fast-A2vHost/master/Fast-A2vHost.sh

chmod +x Fast-A2vHost.sh

./Fast-A2vHost.sh
```
Follow the prompts and your vHost will be created, the directory will be made, but the vHost won't be activated.

Run a2ensite yourdomain.com.conf to enable it after creation.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, compatible with Fast-LAMP.
